# PCMI-XML-EquivariantStableHomotopy
This repository is meant to collect notes and work on the PCMI XML Equivariant Stable Homotopy Theory Project as well as its associated presentation.

Problem Statement:  Define equivariant stable homotopy groups. Find examples of nontrivial elements in the equivariant stable homotopy groups of spheres. Compute the 0-th equivariant stable homotopy group of the sphere S^0 with trivial G-action.

Presentation Outline:
1. Intro to equiv cohomology (example Bredon or Borel) - Use this to motivate spectra (about 4-5 mins)
2. Compute $\pi_0(S^0_G)$ for $G$ a small group (example Klein 4 group, or a cyclic group) - Uses burnside ring

**Note**: The presentations are ~8 minutes long, and will be done on Beamer.

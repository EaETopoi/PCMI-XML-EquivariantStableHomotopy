# PCMI-XML-EquivariantStableHomotopy
This repository is meant to collect notes and work on the PCMI XML Equivariant Stable Homotopy Theory Project as well as its associated presentation.

Problem Statement:  Define equivariant stable homotopy groups. Find examples of nontrivial elements in the equivariant stable homotopy groups of spheres. Compute the 0-th equivariant stable homotopy group of the sphere S^0 with trivial G-action.

Presentation Outline: (each topic ~2 mins) - Link to overleaf document: https://www.overleaf.com/3233396327scdrwdnwmnqt#b28772
1. Non-equivariant stable homotopy, motivating spectra (Trishan)
2. Rep spheres with examples for how they are a generalization of normal spheres (e.g. $S^{\sigma}$ where $\sigma$ is the regular representation of $C_2$ versus $S^2$) (Seth)
3. Equivariant spectra and definition of equivariant stable homotopy groups (Ea E)
4. Theorem for computing the equivariant sphere spectrum, $\pi_0(S^0_G)$, plus Burnside computation examples (Alice)

**Note**: The presentations are ~8 minutes long, and will be done on Beamer.

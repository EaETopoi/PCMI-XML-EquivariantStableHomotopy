# PCMI-XML-EquivariantStableHomotopy
This repository is meant to collect notes and work on the PCMI XML Equivariant Stable Homotopy Theory Project as well as its associated presentation.

A list of resources on Equivariant stable homotopy theory can be found at https://www.homotopytheory.info/g-spectra, but more specifically main references are:
1. Peter May - Equivariant Homotopy and Cohomology Theory (specifically Chapter IX), which can be accessed at https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/BOOKS/alaska.pdf
2. Andrew Blumberg - Notes on Equivariant (un)stable homotopy theory (specifically Chapters 1 and 2, more categorical), which can be accessed at https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/otherpapers/blumberg-burnside.pdf
3. Bertrand Guillou - Class Notes Equivariant Homotopy and Cohomology (more hands on), which can be accesed at https://www.ms.uky.edu/~guillou/F20/751Notes.pdf

# PCMI-XML-EquivariantStableHomotopy
This repository is meant to collect notes and work on the PCMI XML Equivariant Stable Homotopy Theory Project as well as its associated presentation.

Problem Statement:  Define equivariant stable homotopy groups. Find examples of nontrivial elements in the equivariant stable homotopy groups of spheres. Compute the 0-th equivariant stable homotopy group of the sphere S^0 with trivial G-action.
